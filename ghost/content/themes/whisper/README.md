# Whisper

## [View Demo Here](http://thinklens.com/)

Based heavily on the default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/), with a few minor improvements.

Improvements from Casper:
* The 'Source Sans Pro' font is used for body text and the 'Roboto Slab' font is used for header text, including the site header and description
* The header image and logo are included on the post and page template, with a clickable blog title
* The header image uses parallax scrolling with jQuery Parallax
* Posts have a container and the main content has a background color
